# Component 3 for TIC TAC TOE
# To Do
'''
1.  User the code in component 2.a to check if the user know how to play tic tac toe
2. If user already know how to play tic tac toe (for component testing only = print "The game will continue")
   But in the real thing, it is not going ot say that instead the game will just continue itself
4.  If the user does not know how to play tic tac toe or entered "NO" or "no"
    then the game will show the instructions
5.  Create a function where everytime the user presses enter, new sets of instructions are displayed.
